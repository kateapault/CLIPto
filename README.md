<h1>CLIpto</h1>
A command line interface "decoder ring" featuring historical ciphers
<br>
<br>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
The implementation of historical ciphers is very similar to algorithm practice problems, and I enjoy reading about historical ciphers.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Built With</h2>
<p><b>Language:</b> Ruby 2.6.3
<p><b>Gems:</b> TTY-Prompt
<br>
<br>
<h2>Installation</h2>
After downloading the package, run <code>bundle install</code> and then <code>ruby run.rb</code>
<p>The app uses TTY-Prompt and so no flags are required. 
<p>Navigate to the Encode or Decode menus to encode and decode strings or check the Ciphers menu to learn more about the ciphers available.
